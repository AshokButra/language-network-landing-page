      You should remember that you can be ANY age and start learning a new
      language! The idea that there’s a cut-off point for language acquisition
      is incredibly common. People think that unless you learned a language when
      you were a child, there’s no hope and it’ll be near-impossible to grasp.
      <br />
      <br />
      NEWSFLASH: That’s not the case! Learning French as an adult or young adult
      IS possible. You CAN grasp a language, no matter your age. The difference
      between adults learning and children learning is that children are pretty
      much fearless when it comes to making mistakes. Did you know that language
      anxiety affects around a third of adult learners? Because many of us have
      this fear, there’s a risk we miss out on learning key French words and
      phrases. <br />
      <br />
      So whether you’re 5 or 50, you can learn French easily by consistently
      practising! The best way to learn French is to be mindful of the fact that
      languages are about more than just vocabulary and grammar. Languages like
      French are built around people, culture, and connection.
